I am an Associate Professor of International Political Economy and a Fellow of [St. John's College](https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.

My research focuses on the political economy of international cooperation, development, and technological change. My forthcoming book _[Making International Institutions Work](https://ranjitlall.github.io/book/)_ seeks to understand why some international institutions perform better than others. I also have methodological interests in machine learning and the analysis of missing data.

I received my PhD in Government from Harvard University and my BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford. I have received the _Merze Tate Award_ for best dissertation in the field of international relations, law, and politics from the American Political Science Association and the _Leamer-Rosenthal Prize for Open Social Science_ from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences. Before beginning my graduate studies, I worked as an economist at the Bank of England and an editorial writer at the _Financial Times_.
